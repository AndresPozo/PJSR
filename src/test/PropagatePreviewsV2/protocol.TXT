PropagatePreview, testing protocol

Use adhoc workspaces and the workspace TestPropagatePreviews configured as follow:
Image table
|Image|Size|Number of previews|
|I128|128x128|0|
|I256|256x256|0|
|I256_3PV|256x256|3|
|rect|230x100|1|
|rectTarget|230x100|0|


Test behavior when no propgate preview is possible
  Launch on empty instance (test workspace not loaded)
  Launch on instance with a single image without preview (test workspace not loaded)
  Launch on instance with a single image with some previews
     Test for 'propagate previews':
          check that no target can be selected in normal mode
          check that OK gives an error
     Test for 'delete all previews':
          check an error is returned when no image is selected
          check that the single image can be selected and that preview(s) are deleted


Test preview selection (use test workspace I256 and I256_3PV)
  Have an image wihout preview 
  Activate a second image of the same size with three previews
     Test for 'propagate previews':
        Test propagate previews when no, 1, 2, 3 previews are selected
        Test with and without 'keep existing previews'
     Test for 'delete all previews':
        Test delete previews on the target image 
    
Test source image selection and preview selection, test target image selection  (use test workspace)
  Have an image wihout preview (will be I128)
  Have an image of different but proportional size with 3 previews (use I256_3PV)
  Activate a third image 
     Test for 'propagate previews':
        Test that the active image is the default source image
        Test selection of other image as source
        Test selection of targets, check that target cannot be source
        Test propagate to I128 and I256 in SCALE mode

    Test for 'delete all previews':
        Test delete previews on the target images and some empty image, look at log

Test propagate preview from 'rect' to 'rectTarget'

Test zoom factor
Test preserve previews
Test name propagation
